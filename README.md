# Yeoman fabricator-starter generator

This is the fabricator-starter generator for yeoman. It will enable you to quickly setup your 
[fabricator-based](https://github.com/dietergeerts/fabricator-builder) toolkit, and add parts later on when needed. 
See the [yeoman docs](http://yeoman.io/learning/) on how you can work with yeoman.

## Sub-generators

The following is a list of sub-generators, which will add other parts to your toolkit, 
based on the main configuration, for fast development.
